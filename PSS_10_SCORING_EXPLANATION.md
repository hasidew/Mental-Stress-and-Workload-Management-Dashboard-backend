# PSS-10 (Perceived Stress Scale) Scoring Explanation

## Understanding the PSS-10 Methodology

The PSS-10 is a validated psychological assessment tool that measures perceived stress levels. It consists of 10 questions about how often you've felt certain ways during the past 24 hours.

## Question Types and Scoring

### Negative Questions (Direct Scoring)
These questions ask about negative feelings/experiences. Higher scores = more stress.

**Questions 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 10:**
- 0 = Never → 0 points
- 1 = Almost Never → 1 point  
- 2 = Sometimes → 2 points
- 3 = Often → 3 points
- 4 = Very Often → 4 points

### Positive Questions (Reverse Scoring)
These questions ask about positive feelings/experiences. Higher scores = less stress, so we reverse them.

**Questions 4, 5, 7, 8:**
- 0 = Never → 4 points (reversed: never felt positive = high stress)
- 1 = Almost Never → 3 points (reversed)
- 2 = Sometimes → 2 points (reversed)
- 3 = Often → 1 point (reversed)
- 4 = Very Often → 0 points (reversed: always felt positive = no stress)

## Why All "0" Answers Don't Equal Zero Stress

When you answer "0 = Never" to all questions:

### Negative Questions (1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 10)
- You're saying you never felt stressed, overwhelmed, etc.
- **Score: 0 points** (good - no negative stress)

### Positive Questions (4, 5, 7, 8)  
- You're saying you never felt confident, in control, etc.
- **Score: 4 points each** (bad - never feeling positive = stress)
- **Total from positive questions: 16 points**

### Final PSS Score
- **Total: 16/40 points**
- **Normalized: 4.0/10**
- **Stress Level: Low to Moderate**

## Example Calculations

### Scenario 1: All "0" Answers
```
Negative Questions: 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 0 points
Positive Questions: 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 16 points (reversed)
Total PSS: 16/40
Normalized: (16/40) × 10 = 4.0/10
Final Score: (4.0 × 0.6) + (workload × 0.4) = 2.4 + workload
Stress Level: Low (≤3.0) or Moderate (4-6)
```

### Scenario 2: All "4" Answers  
```
Negative Questions: 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 24 points
Positive Questions: 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 0 points (reversed)
Total PSS: 24/40
Normalized: (24/40) × 10 = 6.0/10
Final Score: (6.0 × 0.6) + (workload × 0.4) = 3.6 + workload
Stress Level: Moderate (4-6) or High (7-8.5)
```

### Scenario 3: All "2" Answers
```
Negative Questions: 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 12 points
Positive Questions: 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 8 points (reversed)
Total PSS: 20/40
Normalized: (20/40) × 10 = 5.0/10
Final Score: (5.0 × 0.6) + (workload × 0.4) = 3.0 + workload
Stress Level: Low (≤3.0) or Moderate (4-6)
```

## Why PSS-10 Can't Reach 40 Points

### The Scoring Limitation
The PSS-10 is **intentionally designed** so that the maximum possible score is **24/40**, not 40/40. This is by design, not a bug!

### All Possible Uniform Answer Scenarios:
| Answer Pattern | PSS Score | Normalized | Stress Level |
|----------------|-----------|------------|--------------|
| **All 0s**     | 16/40     | 4.0/10     | Moderate     |
| **All 1s**     | 18/40     | 4.5/10     | Moderate     |
| **All 2s**     | 20/40     | 5.0/10     | Moderate     |
| **All 3s**     | 22/40     | 5.5/10     | Moderate     |
| **All 4s**     | 24/40     | 6.0/10     | Moderate     |

### Why This Design Makes Sense:
1. **No one can score 0 stress** (even with all "0" answers)
2. **No one can score maximum stress** (even with all "4" answers)
3. **The scale is balanced** and realistic
4. **It prevents extreme scores** that wouldn't be psychologically realistic

## Why This Makes Sense

1. **Never feeling positive** (confidence, control, calmness) indicates stress
2. **Always feeling negative** (overwhelmed, stressed, angry) indicates high stress
3. **Balanced feelings** (sometimes positive, sometimes negative) indicates moderate stress
4. **Always feeling positive** indicates low stress

## Final Stress Score Formula

```
Final Score = (Normalized PSS × 0.6) + (Workload Stress × 0.4)
```

Where:
- **Normalized PSS**: Your psychological stress (0-10)
- **Workload Stress**: Your task-based stress (0-2)
- **Final Score**: Combined stress level (0-10)

## Stress Level Thresholds

- **0-3.0**: Low stress
- **4.0-6.0**: Moderate stress  
- **7.0-8.5**: High stress
- **8.6+**: Critical stress

## Conclusion

The PSS-10 is working correctly! All "0" answers result in a **moderate stress score** because:
- You never felt negative emotions (good)
- You never felt positive emotions (bad - indicates stress)

This is the scientifically validated way to measure perceived stress. The system is functioning as intended.
